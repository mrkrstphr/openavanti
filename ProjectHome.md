## OpenAvanti: PHP Application Framework ##

OpenAvanti is an object-oriented application framework written for PHP 5.3+, with support for PDO databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL and sqlite). This framework aims to simplify your application development process by providing you with a skeleton to immediately begin writing code without having to worry about the architectural details.

## What Does it Offer? ##

OpenAvanti offers the following features:

  * MVC Architecture
  * Clean URL routing
  * CRUD Automation
  * Support for the most popular database engines
  * Easy Validation
  * Libraries for image, string, file and XML manipulation

## How is it Different than Other Frameworks? ##

Unlike other, all encompassing frameworks, OpenAvanti does not force you into one method of application development, but instead provides you a set of tools to aid in developing applications the way you want to. If you don't like how something is laid out in OpenAvanti you don't have to use it, but the other tools are still available to you.

OpenAvanti doesn't dictate directory structure or methodology. It's simply a collection of PHP classes that you can selectively use or ignore.
